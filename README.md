# Sysdig Falco
### *Host Activity Monitoring using Sysdig Event Filtering*

## What's Falco?

Falco is a behavioral monitoring agent with native support for containers. 

Falco can detect and alert on any behavior that involves making Linux system calls. Using Sysdig's core decoding and state tracking functionality, Falco alerts can be triggered by the use of specific system calls, their arguments, and by properties of the calling process. Rules are expressed in a high-level, human-readable language. 

## Installing Falco
Instructions for installing via .deb, .rpm, or docker. To be filled in pre-release.

For now, local compilation and installation is the way to install (see "Building Falco" below).

## Configuring Falco

Digwatch is primarily configured via two files: a configuration file (such as the `falco.yaml` in this repository) and a rules file (such as the `falco_rules.conf` file in `rules/`). These two files are written to `/etc` after you install the Falco package.

### Rules file

The rules file is where you define the events and actions that you want to be notified on. We've provided a sample rule file `./rules/falco_rules.conf` as a starting point, but you'll want to familiarize yourself with the contents, and most likely, to adapt it to your environment. 

_Call for contributions: If you come up with additional rules which you think should be part of this core set - PR welcome! And likewise if you have an entirely separate ruleset that may not belong in the core rule set._

A Falco rules file is comprised of two kinds of elements: rules and macro definitions. 

Here's an example of a rule that alerts whenever a bash shell is run inside a container:

`container.id != host and proc.name = bash | WARNING Bash run in a container (%user.name %proc.name %evt.dir %evt.type %evt.args %fd.name)`

The part to the left of the pipe (`|`) is the _condition_. It is expressed using the Sysdig [filter syntax](http://www.sysdig.org/wiki/sysdig-user-guide/#filtering). Any Sysdig filter expression is a valid Falco expression (with the caveat of certain excluded system calls, discussed below). In addition, Falco expressions can contain _macro_ terms, which are not present in Sysdig syntax.

The part to the right of the pipe is the _output_. It is composed of a priority level and an output format. The priority level is case-insensitive and should be one of "emergency", "alert", "critical", "error", "warning", "notice", "informational", or "debug". The output format specifies the message that should be output if a matching event occurs, and follows the Sysdig [output format syntax](http://www.sysdig.org/wiki/sysdig-user-guide/#output-formatting).

Macro definitions provide a way to define common sub-portions of rules in a reusable way. The syntax for a macro is:

`macro_name: macro_definition`

where `macro_name` is a string, and `macro_definition` is any valid Falco condition. 

(_insert example here_).



#### Ignored system calls

For performance reasons, some system calls are currently discarded before Falco processing. The current list is: 
`clock_getres,clock_gettime,clock_nanosleep,clock_settime,close,epoll_create,epoll_create1,epoll_ctl,epoll_pwait,epoll_wait,eventfd,fcntl,fcntl64,fstat,fstat64,getitimer,gettimeofday,nanosleep,poll,ppoll,pread64,preadv,pselect6,pwrite64,pwritev,read,readv,recv,recvfrom,recvmmsg,recvmsg,select,send,sendfile,sendfile64,sendmmsg,sendmsg,sendto,setitimer,settimeofday,shutdown,socket,splice,switch,tee,timer_create,timer_delete,timerfd_create,timerfd_gettime,timerfd_settime,timer_getoverrun,timer_gettime,timer_settime,wait4,write,writev,`




### Configuration file
Falco is configured via a yaml file. The sample config `falco.yaml` in this repo has comments describing the various options.


## Running Falco

Falco is intended to be run as a service. But for experimentation and designing/testing rulesets, you will likely want to run it manually from the command-line.

### Running Falco as a service
Instructions for Centos and Ubuntu.

### Running Falco manually

`falco --help`



## Building Falco
Building Falco requires having `cmake` and `g++` installed.


### Building
Clone this repo in a directory that also contains the sysdig source repo. The result should be something like:

```
22:50 vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/sysdig
$ pwd
/sysdig
22:50 vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:/sysdig
$ ls -l
total 20
drwxr-xr-x  1 vagrant vagrant  238 Feb 21 21:44 falco
drwxr-xr-x  1 vagrant vagrant  646 Feb 21 17:41 sysdig
```

create a build dir, then setup cmake and run make from that dir:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

as a result, you should have a falco executable in `build/userspace/falco/falco`.


### Running locally-built Falco

Assuming you are in the `build` dir, you can run Falco as:

`$ sudo ./userspace/falco/falco -c ../falco.yaml -r ../rules/falco_rules.conf`

Or instead you can try using some of the simpler rules files in `rules`. Or to get started, try creating a file with this:

Create a file with some [Falco rules](Rule-syntax-and-design). For example:
```
write: (syscall.type=write and fd.typechar=f) or syscall.type=mkdir or syscall.type=creat or syscall.type=rename
interactive: proc.pname = bash or proc.pname = sshd
write and interactive and fd.name contains sysdig
write and interactive and fd.name contains .txt
```

And you will see an output event for any interactive process that touches a file with "sysdig" or ".txt" in its name!
